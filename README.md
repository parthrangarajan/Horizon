# Horizon
An end-to-end text summarizing ML web-app. **Ever felt like you're wasting too much time reading something?Want to reduce that time spent? Horizon is your answer**. It summarizes large text and gives you the main points to have a look at.

Flask and Python is used as the backend with an NLTk model and SpaCy model as its foundation. The frontend used CSS, JavaScript and HTML along with materialize.css to give the site a proffessional-esque apperance.

You can choose among 4 available summarization libraries namely: SpaCy, Sumy, Nltk ad gensim. More about these libraries are in the About section of the web-app. 

You can find the app on: https://horizon-by-pr.herokuapp.com/

P.S. : I havent added the **static** files.
